## Project Features
- Real-time view and session
- A convenient zoom lens
- AI support for better accessibility
- Recognizing text on web pages and force highlighting it
- A simple Braille display for visually impaired users

## Real-time View and Session
The platform provides a real-time view and an active session feature, allowing users to access and interact with web content as if they were using a browser. Users can click, hover, and send inputs as they would on regular websites. Since advanced accessibility features require direct control over the browsing experience, Accessweb simulates a browser environment and streams it to the user. 

For individuals with low vision, zooming in and out on web pages often disrupts navigation, especially with dynamic content. Ultra-zooming can also distort the structure of websites. Accessweb offers a solution by providing an interactive, accessible browsing experience without such limitations.

## A Convenient Zoom Lens
Accessweb includes a zoom lens that allows users to magnify web pages without altering their structure. This feature ensures better DOM stability and adapts to dynamic content changes. Users can adjust the size and scale according to their needs. Traditional zooming methods often cause navigation difficulties, but this feature helps maintain a smooth browsing experience.

## AI Support for Better Accessibility
Finding specific components or sections on a webpage can be challenging, especially with ultra-zoom. Accessweb includes AI support to assist users in locating and interacting with webpage elements. Instead of spending time searching manually, users can ask the AI assistant to perform actions for them, improving efficiency and ease of use.

## Recognizing Text on Web Pages and Force Highlighting It
Accessweb can recognize text on web pages and force highlight it, making content more readable for visually impaired users. This feature is particularly useful for users who have difficulty locating text, ensuring that key information remains accessible.

## A Simple Braille Display for Visually Impaired Users
For individuals who are blind but sensitive to light, Accessweb offers a Braille display using white circles that simulate Braille bumps. Users are encouraged to maximize their monitor brightness, turn off room lights, and position themselves close to the screen for the best experience. This is an innovative approach that, to our knowledge, has not been implemented elsewhere.The commit is [here](https://github.com/AYUSHKHAIRE/web-view/commit/4a2090bb8757382cc50cd4b0bab6f59baa48cff0)
